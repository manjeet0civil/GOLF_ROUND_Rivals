Project Overview: Multi‑Player Live Golf Scorecard Web App

1. Purpose
Build a responsive web application that allows golfers to create, join, and play live, multi‑player rounds of golf. Each round is tracked hole‑by‑hole, with automatic score calculations, handicaps, net scores, and final rankings. Players must authenticate before participating, and hosts can invite others via a unique join link.

2. Core User Flows
2.1. Authentication
Register (email + password) or Login

Passwords securely hashed (e.g. bcrypt)

Session maintained via JWT or secure cookies

2.2. Game Creation (Host)
Click “New Game”

Select or enter Course Details (18 holes, par values)

Set Game Options:

Max players (optional)

Game name

App generates a unique join link (e.g. yourapp.com/join/XYZ123)

Host can view lobby of joined players and start the game when ready

2.3. Joining a Game (Player)
Authenticate (if not already logged in)

Visit the join link

See host name, course info, current player list

Click “Join” to enter the lobby

2.4. Live Score Entry
Once the host clicks “Start Game”, the Scorecard UI appears for all players

Real‑Time Updates via WebSockets (e.g. Socket.IO)

Each player sees a table:

Player	H1	H2	H3	…	H18	OUT	IN	Total	Handicap	Net
Par	4	3	5	…	4	36	36	72	—	—
Player A	5	4	6	…	3	41	33	74	12	62
Player B	4	3	5	…	4	36	38	74	10	64

Editable stroke inputs per hole

Automatic calculations for:

OUT (sum H1–H9)

IN (sum H10–H18)

Total = OUT + IN

Net Score = Total − Handicap

2.5. Ending the Game & Leaderboard
Host clicks “End Game”

Inputs locked for all players

Server computes ranks sorted by Net Score (lowest first)

Display final leaderboard table with medal icons 🥇🥈🥉

Option to download or share final scorecard (PDF/CSV link)
